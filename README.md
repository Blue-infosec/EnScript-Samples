# EnScript-Samples
This repository is a collection of EnScript code samples for use in the Guidance Software Inc. EnCase application. It is very much a work in progress.

EnScript is a proprietary scripting language with roots in C++. It also has elements of Java and C#.

EnScripts can include other EnScript library files, resource files and .NET assemblies. They can be packaged into files with an 'EnPack' file-extension.

Each script in this repository has been tested/developed using EnCase 7/8 unless specified otherwise.

If you'd like to see an example of how to accomplish a particular thing please feel free to raise an issue and I will look at it as soon as I'm able.
